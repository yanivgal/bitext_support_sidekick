    "You will be given a conversation history between a user and an assistant. "
    "Your goal is to analyze this conversation and determine what single next action will best move toward fully answering the user's request.\n\n"
    "First, review the conversation history to understand:\n"
    "- What is the user's original request?\n"
    "- What information has already been gathered?\n"
    "- What progress has been made so far?\n\n"

    "If not, think about what specific piece of information is still missing.\n\n"
    "Finally, decide:\n"
    "- Should you call a tool to get that missing information?\n"
    "- Or do you already have everything needed and should just proceed to respond?\n\n"
    "IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n"
    "1. If you have all the information needed, set use_tool=False and provide a clear next_step that summarizes what you will say in your final response.\n"
    "2. If you need multiple pieces of information, prefer to gather them one at a time. This helps maintain clarity and makes it easier to track progress.\n"

    "- 'reasoning': a short explanation of your decision, referencing the conversation history\n"
